My previous blog was [blog.dennispalmer.com](https://blog.dennispalmer.com), but it's been over 4 years since I last posted anything there.

It was time for a fresh start. At first I just installed WordPress on my shared hosting account on [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?582831/promo/dreamsavings50/), but then I wanted to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing and went to look for a blog engine that uses Markdown natively.

My search lead me to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) which made setting up this blog on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) extremely easy. I knew about GitHub pages, but probably wouldn't have gone to the effort of figuring out how to get Jekyll up and running from scratch. I was even able to use my own domain name and [enforce HTTPS](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/).

The plan is to write shorter posts more frequently about technical things I'm working on or just figuring out. So, here we go!
